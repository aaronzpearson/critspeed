\description{
This function returns the set duration, log(duration), and the model fits and residuals for the OmVD, 5 parameter, 
3 parameter, and 2 parameter, exponential, and exponential decay models.
}
\details{
Using nonlinear regression, `minpack.lm::nlsLM`, you can fit the six mathematical models (CV2, CV3, OmVD, 5-PL, exp, exp decay). 
The initial values for the regressions are `crit.speed.estim = 3.5` in m/s, `d.prime.estim = 150` in m, and 
`max.speed.estim = 12` in  m/s. These values were chosen after nonlinear regressions with an array of starting values 
(1, 3.5, and 5 for CV; 80, 150, and 1500 for Dâ€™; and 7, 12 and 15 for Vmax) converged to the same final values.  
The regression optimized parameters using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to minimize the residual sum-of-squares (RSS).  

`cs.results.fitted` returns a data frame that contains the selected duration, 
the player's max mean or max median speed vector, model fits, and model residuals. The returned data
frame can then be used to produce plots like those created using the `cs.results.plot` function.

`raw.data` should be set to `FALSE` if it is pre-processed max mean or max median speed data. To 
pre-process the data, the functions `critspeed`, `max.mean.speed.df` or `max.median.speed.df` must be called, and the 
resulting data frame saved as an object or loaded from your device.

If `raw.data` is set to `TRUE`, you can opt for the duration, `dur`, to be set to one (1L) or "roecker" 
values. Setting `dur` to a single value will return fitted values for 1/`sample.rate` to the desired max duration. When 
`dur` is set to "roecker", the default durations are 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.5, 10, 13.5, 18,
30, 60, 120, 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1800, 2400, and 2700 s. If `roecker` is set to `TRUE` and a single value 
is provided, the durations will be 1/`sample.rate` to the assigned `dur`. If `roecker` is set to `TRUE` and multiple values 
are provided, the provided duration vector will be assessed in s. Please note that when interested in the max 
mean speed, `dur` MUST be a duration of 1L (a single value) and `rocker` MUST be set to `FALSE`.

The `d.prime.estim`, `crit.speed.estim`, and `max.speed.estim` should be set to realistic values. The default
values have been validated. If different values are selected, the results should be either similar or the same 
when the nls function (`minpack.lm::nlsLM`) attempts to minimize the RSS. 

The 2 parameter model has been validated when the minimum duration is set to 120 s, or 2 min. This value, `cv.2`, 
can be over-written. Please note that by selecting a different minimum duration will return different 
model results. Although they can be similar, they are not the same and can vary greatly.
}
\note{
Errors can arise when `dur` and `roecker` are used inappropriately. Errors can also arise when the 
data set does not contain enough observations. Ensure that you have properly utilized your data and the provided 
arguments when errors are returned.
