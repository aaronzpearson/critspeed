\description{
This function returns the fitted parameter estimates for the the OmVD, 5 parameter, 
3 parameter, and 2 parameter, and exponential models. The exponential decay model is omitted 
because of parameter redundancies with the exponential model.
}
\details{
Unlike `model.fits` that returns the fitted values, this function returns the optimized parameters using 
the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm that was used to minimize the residual sum-of-squares (RSS). Using nonlinear regression, 
`minpack.lm::nlsLM`, you can fit the five mathematical models (CV2, CV3, OmVD, 5-PL, exp). The initial values 
for the regressions are `crit.speed.estim = 3.5` in m/s, `d.prime.estim = 150` in m, and `max.speed.estim = 12` 
in  m/s. These values were chosen after nonlinear regressions with an array of starting values (1, 3.5, and 5 
for CV; 80, 150, and 1500 for Dâ€™; and 7, 12 and 15 for Vmax) converged to the same final values. Goodness of fit 
values are also included in the output and include root square error (RSE), residual sum-of-squares (RSS),
Akaike's Inclusion Criterion (AIC), and Bayesion Information Criterion (BIC). 

`global.data` should be set to `TRUE` if it is pre-processed max mean or max median speed data. To 
pre-process the data, the functions `max.mean.speed.df` or `max.median.speed.df` must be called, and the 
resulting data frame saved as an object or loaded from your device.

If `global.data` is set to `FALSE`, you can opt for the duration, `dur`, to be set to one (1L) or "roecker" 
values. Setting `dur` to a single value will return fitted values for 1/`sample.rate` to the desired max duration. When 
`dur` is set to "roecker", the default durations are 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.5, 10, 13.5, 18,
30, 60, 120, 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1800, 2400, and 2700 s. If `roecker` is set to `TRUE` and a single value 
is provided, the durations will be 1/`sample.rate` to the assigned `dur`. If `roecker` is set to `TRUE` and multiple values 
are provided, the provided duration vector will be assessed in s. Please note that when interested in the max 
mean speed, `dur` MUST be a duration of 1L (a single value) and `rocker` MUST be set to `FALSE`.

The `d.prime.estim`, `crit.speed.estim`, and `max.speed.estim` should be set to realistic values. The default
values have been validated. If different values are selected, the results should be either similar or the same 
when the nls function (`minpack.lm::nlsLM`) attempts to minimize the RSS. 

The 2 parameter model has been validated when the minimum duration is set to 120 s, or 2 min. This value, `cv.2`, 
can be over-written. Please note that by selecting a different minimum duration will return different 
model results. Although they can be similar, they are not the same and can vary greatly.
}
\note{
Errors can arise when `dur` and `roecker` are used inappropriately. Errors can also arise when the 
data set does not contain enough observations. Ensure that you have properly utilized your data and the provided 
arguments when errors are returned.#'
