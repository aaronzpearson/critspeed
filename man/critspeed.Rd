\title{Maximal Mean and Maximal Median Speed per Duration}
\usage{
critspeed(
  player.speed,
  dur = 600,
  sample.rate = 10,
  method = c("mean", "median")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{player.speed}{the player's speed vector}

\item{dur}{duration(s) to calculate max mean or max median speed, default set to 600 s (see notes)}

\item{sample.rate}{in Hz, default set to 10 Hz}

\item{method}{indicates whether the max mean or max median speed should be calculated}
}
\description{
A \code{data.frame} that contains the greatest mean or median speed per duration.
}
\details{
The \code{critspeed()} function calculates the moving averages or medians for an athlete's speed over a given duration. \code{player.speed} should be 
input as the speed variable from the player's tracking data.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item \code{dur}: Either an integer of length 1L or \code{"roecker"}
\itemize{
\item When an integer is input, the \code{data.frame} returned will encompass all values from 0.1 to \code{dur}
\item An input of \code{"roecker"} selects the following durations, as was suggested by Roecker, Mahler, Heyde, RÃ¶ll, & Gollhofer (2017): 0L, 0.3L, 0.5L, 1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L, 6.5L, 10L, 13.5L, 18L, 30L, 60L, 120L, 300L, 600L, 900L, 1200L, 1800L, 2400L, 2700L. Note that these durations *must* return integers when multiplied by the \code{sample.rate}. For example, 0.3 s at 10 Hz returns a value of 3. If the \code{sample.rate} is 5, the value returned is 1.5 and will result in an error.
}
\item If \code{method} is assigned as \code{"median"}, processing time and resources are significantly increased. It is suggested that users opt for \code{dur = "roecker"} to minimize processing time and resources. 
\item This function relies heavily on \code{data.table} and \code{Rfast}, both of which use a C++ back-end. In doing so, 
processing time is significantly decreased at the cost of computer resources. It is suggested that CPU and RAM 
be available when running \code{critspeed()} to minimize the risk of an error occurring. Common \code{Error} messages 
returned are that there is not enough memory available to assign a vector of size x MB. To avoid this error, 
sufficient RAM must be available on your local machine.
