\title{Max Median Speed}
\usage{
\method{max}{median.speed}(x, n = "roecker", sample.rate = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{player speed vector}

\item{n}{durations}

\item{sample.rate}{in Hz}
}
\description{
This is a helper function that feeds into `max.median.speed.df`.
}
\details{
The arguments for this function are minimal and it is not suggested that this function be 
used on its own.

`n` is in arbitrary units and does not take into account sample rate. Therefore, 
users should be cautious when calling `max.median.speed` exclusively.
