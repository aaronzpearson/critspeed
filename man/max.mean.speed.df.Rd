\title{Max Mean Speed Data Frame}
\usage{
\method{max}{mean.speed.df}(player.speed, sample.rate = 10, dur = 600)
}
\arguments{
\item{player.speed}{player speed vector}

\item{sample.rate}{in Hz, default set to 10 Hz}

\item{dur}{max duration, default set to 600 s}
}
\description{
A data frame that contains the greatest average speed per duration.
}
\details{
The function `max.mean.speed` calculates the moving averages for the velocity data for durations 
from 0.1 sec to `dur` sec using a default resolution (`sample.rate`) of 10 Hz. 600 s was chosen as the 
longest duration because this duration was previously used in similar studies (Delaney et al., 2018; 
Quod, Martin, Martin, & Laursen, 2010).  

Next, the `max.mean.speed` extracts the highest mean velocity for each duration. It is recommended to repeat this 
process for all data sets per athlete, thereby obtaining the velocity-duration profile using the greatest 
moving average velocities for each duration across all files.  

The user is returned a data set via `max.mean.speed.df` that contains the greatest average speed that a  
player can maintain for a given duration. The user has the ability to select a max duration of length 1L 
(1 value) or can input a vector to return distinct max mean speed values. Observations are returned at the 
given sample rate. For example, if `dur` is 600 and `sample.rate` is 10, a data frame containing 6000 max
mean speed observations will be returned. Conversely, if `dur` is c(10, 50, 100) and `sample.rate` is 10, a 
data frame containing 3 max mean speed observations will be returned. Note that `dur` 600 and c(1:600) return 
the same data sets. Also note that the use of multiple `dur` values is not always supported in functions that 
`max.mean.speed.df` feeds into. 

The default `dur` and `sample.rate` arguments have been validated for use in the modelling process. It 
is not suggested that the user changes these values. 

Please note that the max mean speed is calculated using `data.table::frollmean` which uses a C++ back-end. 
In doing so, this function can be temporarily taxing on your system. It is suggested that this 
function be called when the system has available RAM and CPU. Otherwise, an error message can be 
returned indicating that a vector of size x Mb cannot be assigned.  

For those interested in the maximal median speed, like that used by Roecker, Mahler, Heyde, RÃ¶ll, & 
Gollhofer (2017) see `max.median.speed.df`. Please note that calculating the max mean speed is much 
faster than the max median speed.
